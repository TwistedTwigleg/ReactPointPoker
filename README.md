# React Point Poker

A simple React project using [Mantine](https://ui.mantine.dev) components for helping with Scrum/Agile Point Poker. The code provides a page for creating or joining a room, voting on the points for a ticket/issue/thing, and then resetting. It does not provide chat support or similar, it is assumed to be used in a meeting or discussion to happen on another platform in parallel to using the website.

*Note: This project likely does not follow React best practices - it's more a learning project. As such, support, fixes, and code quality may vary. Thank you!*
